## Getting Started
So I made a game. This game is written in the Unity 2019.4.16f1. It has a beginning and an end. There are three different states: MenuState, StartState, PlayState and EndState in the game.
#### StartState
There are three buttons:
* Start - to start game
* Menu - to choose the levels
* Exit - to escape the game
#### MenuState
There are three levels. You will be taken to the level you selected when you click.
#### PlayState
Ð•hese are all three levels that I did, there is also a stopwatch

#### EndState
There are two buttons:
* Restart - to take to StartState
* Exit - to escape the game

Also there is a table of records with the time you spent on completing each of the levels.

 My game is in the puzzle genre. During the creation of this game, I did not use any libraries and relied only on my knowledge. I have fulfilled all the conditions written on the [specification](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/projects/final/final/#specification).

### WHAT IS IN THE GAME?
* The yellow brick needs to get outside.
* The blue brick acts as a movable wall that moves perpendicular to the movement of the yellow brick.
* The green brick has the same function as the blue one, but moves parallel to the yellow one.
* White brick is a wall that can become transparent after pressing a gameplay button.

### CONTROLS
* The yellow brick moves by pressing the "W" & "S" keys.
* The green brick moves by pressing the "W" & "S" keys.
* The blue brick moves by pressing the "A" & "D" keys.
* White brick does not move and has no control.
* To restart the level, press the "R" key.
* To go to the next level before completion, you need to press the "N" key.
